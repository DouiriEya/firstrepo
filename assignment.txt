web development is getting to develp websites in a way to help the user and serve him online.
Web development can be devided to two main parts :
 1.front end 
 2.back end 
working with two interfaces makes web development so essential nowadays simply because it translates the user's needs to code
and actual working site ready to be used .


HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
HTML is used to create web pages.

to be honest i'am not that familiar with css but i think it works with HTML because some features are "limited" in HTML
so for more complicated featuresso css and javascript be combined with HTML


javascript is a programming Language and it's one of the most used languages for client-side web developement 


i don't know what node.js is tbh:)
